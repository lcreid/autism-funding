    # Spent funds should really be just that which is paid for by the Ministry.
    # This requires us to line up the invoices with RTPs.
    # The criteria would be something like: The invoice service provider
    # or supplier must match the service provider or supplier in an approved
    # RTP, and the service dates must be within the range of service dates,
    # if both are provided, and the RTP must not be all used up.
    # It might be convenient to put that into the Invoice model...
    # Or maybe not. It also makes sense that it should all be here where the
    # rules for figuring this out, reside.

    # In most cases, an invoice goes against exactly one RTP. In that case,
    # it's pretty easy to figure out what has to be paid out-of-pocket, and
    # what has been/will be paid by the ministry.
    # This still applies even if the RTP has both Part A and Part B. You just
    # have to match by the right criteria and use the right amount.
    # The complication is overlapping RTPs for the service provider or agency,
    # so that an invoice could apply to more than one RTP.
    # For invoices that go against two RTPs: One rule would be that they would
    # go against the RTP that had the most space first, and then the other if
    # there wasn't enough funding. Another rules would be to go against the
    # first RTP, by start date, then end date, then creation date.
    # Another is that it doesn't matter which they "go against." The total is
    # what's important, as long as you don't double count the invoices that
    # overlap.
