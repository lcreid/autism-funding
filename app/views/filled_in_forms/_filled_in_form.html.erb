<%# I could do this as a separate partial for each type of form, but the
    buttons would be the same for all partials. I could handle that with
    helpers, but I don't really need to do it yet, so just render the same
    partial for all form types, and ensure that all form types have the
    methods or attributes needed by this partial. %>
<tr class="static-form-record">
    <td><%= form.form.form_name %></td>
    <td><%= form.service_provider_name %></td>
    <td class="text-right">
        <%= form.updated_at.to_date.to_formatted_s(:iso8601) %>
    </td>
    <td class="text-right">
      <%= number_to_currency(form.service_provider_service_amount) %>
    </td>
    <td>
      <%= form.status %>
    </td>
    <td>
        <%= edit_button(form, class: 'btn-xs') %>
        <%= print_button(form, class: 'btn-xs') %> <%#=link_to('Print', '#', class: "btn btn-xs btn-primary") %>
        <%= link_to('Delete', '#', class: "btn btn-xs btn-danger") %>
    </td>
</tr>
