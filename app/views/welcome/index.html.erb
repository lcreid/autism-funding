    <h1>Autism Funding</h1>
    <p>
      This site helps you manage your autism funding.
      You can fill out forms,
      print them,
      and send them to the Ministry.
      Then you can easily track
      how much you've committed,
      and how much you've spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're just getting started.
      Our first goal is to support parents
      and care-givers
      in the province of British Columbia.
      We hope to support other provinces in the future.

      <p>
        Keep track of how much of your funding
        you've committed,
        how much has actually been spent,
        and how much you have to left to spend.
        Estimate when you'll run out of funding,
        to help you budget for those parts of the year
        where you might have to pay out of pocket.

      <h2>For Service Providers</h2>
      <p>
        Right now, our application is targeted at helping families and care
        givers, but, if demand drives us, we'd like to extend our application
        so that we can help Service Providers.  This application could allow you
        to see how much funding you're approved for,
        so you can help your families stay up-to-date
        with their funding applications,
        meaning fewer delays in paying your invoices.

        extend our application to help Service Providers as well
        as families.
